#Code Challenge

I decided to use React with MUI, as it has been my bread and butter lately. The json data I utilized didn't have active links for their images, so there is currently a placehold hard-coded in. The user should be able to search based on key terms, found in the author's name, book title or publishing year. If the data included a description, that easily could have been implemented as well.  Thanks for the consideration, I really enjoyed making this little application. 

## Installation
Clone repo, use npm to install dependencies. Application should run on the script:
```bash
npm start
```
